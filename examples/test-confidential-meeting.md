# Personal Note from CEO

Had dinner with Thomas Chen last night. He mentioned their star researcher Dr. Lisa Park is considering an offer from Google. If we lose her, the acquisition value drops significantly. 

Personal reminder: Thomas's daughter Emma (age 8) starts at Pacific Elementary next month. His wife Maria is a pediatric nurse at UCSF. Good leverage points for relationship building.

Confidential: The board doesn't know about the Google threat yet. Need to accelerate timeline.
